# Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. 
# The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. 
# User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."
# For better understanding you can also watch a youtube vide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8xctqrzSSA&t=419s
