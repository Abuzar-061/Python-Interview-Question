# ================= Encapsulation ====================
# DEFINATION : 
# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
# It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
# This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data


# =================== Abstraction ====================
# Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. 
# The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. 
# User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."
